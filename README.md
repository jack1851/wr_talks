# Defense Slides
Holding `beamer`-based LaTeX slides for my defense with
a `beamer` style using UMN colors and the experimental logos.

- `figs` : directory holding slide-specific figures and plots
- `cms_logo.png` and `goldy_leaning.png` : cms and UMN logos included in header of each slide
- `preamble.tex` : preamble that defines helpful commands and colors, and defining style of slides
- `slides.tex` : actual source for slides that `\input`s the other preamble files at the top
