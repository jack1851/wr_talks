\section{Background}

\subsection{Handedness and Weak Interactions}

\begin{frame}{Parity Violation in $\beta$ Decay}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The parity operator $\hat{P}$ corresponds to a discrete 
      transformation $x \rightarrow -x$, etc.
    \item In 1957 C.S. Wu studied the beta decay:
      $\ce{^{60}_{27}Co \rightarrow ^{60}_{28}Ni + e^{-} + \bar{\nu_{e}}}$
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\footnotesize
\item No time for an outline, lets just dive right in. 
 The story really begins with the discovery of parity violation.
\item Parity symmetry (which is also informally some called the mirror symmetry) is the idea that for a given physical process, that
  process with its spatial coordinates inverted - or reflected in a mirror - 
  also represents another perfectly possible physical process.
\item And in 1957, Wu conducted this experiment in which she aligned the spins 
  of Cobalt-60 nuclei in a strong magnetic field. Cobalt-60 beta decays in a weak 
  interaction to nickel, an electron and antineutrino, and Wu recorded the directions 
  of the emitted electrons relative to the magnetic field. 
\item If we consider this process under a parity transformation, the only kinematic quantity that changes sign
  is the vector momentum of the emitted electrons, since the magnetic field and magnetic moment are
  both axial vectors. So, if parity were conserved in weak interactions, the rate at which electrons were
  emitted at a certain direction relative to the magnetic field would be identical to the rate in the opposite
  direction. And this is what they expected to find.
\item Experimentally however, it was observed that most electrons were emitted in the hemisphere opposite
  to the direction of the applied magnetic field, thus providing a clear demonstration that parity is violated 
  in weak interactions.
\item It was a bizarre and surprising result, with the implication being that the weak force is left-handed.

\note[itemize]{
\item So what do we exactly mean by left-handed? Or right-handed.
\item Well when we talk about handedness as a property, theres two ways you can think about it. 
\item The first is in terms of helicity, which is the projection of the particles 
  spin along its direction of momentum.
\item If you consider this muon decay, you'll see that there are two possible helicity states 
  for a spin-half fermion. 
\item The first is right-handed, which is when the spin and momentum are aligned, 
  which you can see with the positron and antineutrino here.
\item The other helicity state is left-handed, which is when the spin 
  and momentum are antialigned, as shown with the outgoing neutrino here.
\item But it is important to remember that helicity is not Lorentz invariant. This is because for particles 
  with mass, it is always possible to boost into a frame in which the direction of the particle's momentum 
  is reversed and therefore the helicity flips. 
\item And because of this, helicity cannot be a fundamental property of particles.
}

\begin{frame}{Chiral States}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \boldcol{UMNSunny}{Chirality}: The Lorentz invariant ``version'' of helicity and an intrinsic property of particles.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item In general, define the eigenstates of $\gamma^{5}$ as \boldcol{UMNMaroon}{left} and \boldcol{UMNMaroon}{right-handed chiral} states
      \end{itemize}
    \item \boldcol{UMNSunny}{Ultra-relativistic limit}:
      $E >> m$
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Chiral eigenstates correspond to helicity eigenstates.
      \end{itemize}
    \item \boldcol{UMNSunny}{Spinor Decomposition}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Can write any spinor in terms of its left and right-handed chiral components
      \end{itemize}
      $$
        \Psi = \Psi_{L} + \Psi_{R} = P_{L}\Psi + P_{R}\Psi = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \gamma^{5}\right)\Psi + \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \gamma^{5}\right)\Psi
      $$
    \item \boldcol{UMNSunny}{Projection Operators}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Project out the chiral eigenstates:
      \end{itemize}
      $$
        \boxed{P_{L} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \gamma^{5}\right) \quad P_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \gamma^{5}\right)}
      $$
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item Fortunately, there is a Lorentz invariant version of helicity, which is called chirality. 
\item I say "version" in quotes because unlike helicity, chirality does not have a simple physical interpretation. 
\item But in general, the eigenstates of the gamma 5-matrix are defined as left- and right-handed chiral states.
\item And the link between helicity and chirality appears in the massless limit. In this limit, helicity and chirality 
  eigenstates are the same, so saying a particle is left-handed means both left-handed helicity and left-handed chirality. 
  But if you aren't in this limit, helicity and chirality eigenstates are generally different and you just have to be 
  careful about which one you are referring to.  
\item Now any Dirac spinor can be decomposed into left- and right-handed chiral components using these two chiral 
  projection operators $P_L$ and $P_R$.
\item $P_L$ projects out left-handed chiral particle states of spinors and $P_R$ projects out right-handed chiral particle states.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Only \boldcol{UMNMaroon}{left-handed chiral} components of 
          particle spinors participate in charged weak interactions.
        \item No theoretical explanation as to \emph{why} 
          the weak force is left-handed.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}

        \caption{The LRSM right-handed weak vertex.}
      \end{figure}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduce $W_{R}^{\pm}$ bosons to couple to \boldcol{UMNMaroon}{right-handed chiral} components of 
        particle spinors.
        \item Parity restored as a symmetry to the standard model.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item So when we say that the weak force is left-handed, what we mean was that the W-boson couples to
  the left-chiral component of particle spinors.
\item This can be seen in the Feynmann Diagram on the left, where we have a lepton and a neutrino coupling 
  to a Standard Model W boson. The contribution to the amplitude is given by this interaction vertex, which 
  \emph{includes} a factor of the left-chiral projection operator. This means that the W boson only couples to 
  left-chiral particle states and does not interact with right-chiral particle states.
\item But there is no theoretical reason behind this. There's nothing in the Standard Model that tells 
  us that the charged weak interaction vertex should include the left chiral projection operator, instead 
  of the right chiral projection operator, or no projection operator at all, which is the case for QED 
  and QCD. This is just something that has been determined from experiment. 
\item Left-right symmetric models add right-handed W bosons, meaning heavier W bosons that couple to the right chiral 
  component of particle spinors, and you can see that there is a factor of the right chiral projection operator at 
  the vertex.
\item And lastly, if we assume that the two coupling constants are equal to each other, then there is an explicit left-right 
  symmetry and parity is restored to the standard model.

\note[itemize]{
\item OK so to just wrap up the background here.
\item Left-right symmetric models postulate that parity violation is a low energy phenomenon, the result 
 of a broken symmetry that is restored at high energies.
\item The left-right symmetric standard model is summarized in this table, with standard model extensions 
  highlighted in red.
\item Most botably, we have extended the electroweak gauge group to include an SU(2)R symmetry group 
    in addition to the usual SU(2)L. 
\item Then, just as the left-handed fermions are doublets under SU(2)L, so too now do right-handed fermions 
  form doublets under SU(2)R.
\item Of course, we must add right-handed neutrinos to go with the right-handed leptons to form doublets
  under SU(2)R. 
\item And these right-handed fermions have charged current interactions mediated by the charged gauge bosons 
  of SU(2)R, which we can call WR±. 
\item There is also a heavy neutral boson called Z prime which also has its own, completely seperate search.

\note[itemize]{
  \item This feynmann diagram gives us a sense of what exactly we are looking for. 
  \item We have two qaurks coming in, annihilating and producing a right-handed W. 
  That right-handed W decays to a lepton and a heavy neutrino. That heavy neutrino 
  then decays back into a same flavor lepton and an off-shell right handed W, which 
  then decays into two quarks which hadronize to jets. 
  \item So, the observable objects in the decay are two same flavor leptons, and two jets.

\note[itemize]{
  \footnotesize
  \item We search for the right-handed W using the CMS detector at the LHC.
  \item The CMS detector is a general-purpose detector, designed to improve the precision 
    of standard model measurements, as well discover any new physics that the LHC might 
    produce. It is layered like a cylindrical onion, with several concentric layers.
  \item Starting from the innermost layer is the silicon tracker, which measures the 
    trajectories of muons, electrons and charged hadrons emerging from the beam pipe. 
    The trajectories of these particles are then used to reconstruct their momentum.
  \item Beyond the tracker lie two calorimeters: the Electromagnetic Calorimeter, or 
    ECAL, which measures the energy of electrons and photons, and the Hadronic Calorimeter 
    or HCAL, which measures the energy of hadrons.
  \item  The central feature of the detector is the superconducting solenoid, which provides 
    a magnetic field of 3.8 T. The magnetic field bends the path of charged particles as they 
    traverse the detector, which in combination with the tracker allows their transverse momentum 
    to be reconstructed.
  \item In the outermost layers we have iron yoke interspersed with muon chambers. Muons are 
    not stopped by the ECAL, so we detect them and measure their energy in these outermost chambers.

\note[itemize]{
  \footnotesize
  \item The general strategy that we use to search for the right-handed W and heavy 
    neutrino is the classic resonance search, otherwise known as bump hunting. 
  \item The way that this works is we add up the four-momentum vectors of our final 
    state products and square them to get their invariant mass, which we call the 
    four-object invariant mass, or mlljj. 
  \item Then by conservation of energy and momentum, the four-object invariant mass is 
    equal to the mass of the right-handed W.
  \item This is important because the right-handed W is a propagator, and so it takes a 
    factor of 1 over mlljj squared minus mw squared in its matrix element, where mw is 
    the on shell mass. So when mlljj approaches the on shell mass of the right 
    handed w, there is a resonance in the cross section.
  \item Now if you look at this cartoon I've drawn in the bottom left you can see how 
   this appears on four object invariant mass spectrum. 
  \item The number of events on the y-axis is really just the cross section times the 
   luminosity, so this excess of events over standard model background expectations is due to this 
   resonance in the WR cross section.
  \item And I should say that the reason we favor this particular decay mode, is that we can also use this 
    same technique to measure the mass of the heavy neutrino by looking at the ljj mass spectrum. So in a 
    sense we can kill two birds with one stone by examining this particular decay mode.

  \item So when one of our final state quarks hadronizes, it produces a shower of particles that 
    pass through the CMS detector in a narrow cone. Rather than trying to track the energy and 
    momentum of each one of those particles, CMS clusters these particles together using something 
    called the anti kt algorithm and calls the collection of those particles a jet and we look at 
    the energy and momenta of that object as a whole.
  \item The sizes of these jets are defined in terms of the angular separation or angular distance 
    $\Delta R$, which is a measure of how collimated the particles in a jet are. The two most common 
    jet sizes are $\Delta R = 0.4$ and $\Delta R = 0.8$.
  \item There are two regions in the analysis, and so far I have only discussed this first one, the 
    resolved region. In the resolved search, we are searching for four isolated objects: two leptons, which
    I have drawn in green here, and two ak4 jets which are these blue cones. And we search for signal 
    in the four object invariant mass spectrum.
  \item But, there is another region called the boosted region. This occurs when the mass of the 
    right-handed W is much greater than the mass the heavy neutrino. Then, when the WR decays, the heavy 
    neutrino will be produced with a large momentum, and then the three decay predicts of the heavy 
    neutrino will be highly collimated as they pass through the detector. So then rather than try to 
    reconstruct each of these objects individually, we cluster them into an AK8 jet, which we also call 
    a fat jet.
  \item So then in the boosted region, we have two objects: a well isolated lepton shown here in green, 
    and the neutrino decay products, which we reconstruct as a fat jet. We then use the invariant mass 
    of these two objects to search for signal.
  \item But for the rest of this talk, I am only going to focus on the resolved region.

\note[itemize]{
\item Of course, in order to be able to observe any signal events, you have to know your backgrounds extremely
  well. 
\item The two main backgrounds that result in a two lepton two jet final state are drell-yan and tt bar.
\item In Drell-yan events we have qq bar annhilation producing a Z or a photon, which decays to two leptons,
  and we get two jets from ISR or FSR radiation. 
\item In ttbar, if you look at this top quark here, the top quark decays to a bottom and a W, and the W decays 
  to a lepton and a neutrino. And a similar thing with the anti top quark. So in tt bar events we also have a 
  two lepton and two jet final state. 
\item A major difference between them that I want to point out is that with drell-yan events, the leptons are 
  constrained to have the same-flavor. Whereas with ttbar events, the top quarks decay independently, so the leptons 
  can have different flavors. And we are going to use this to our advantage in the next couple of slides here.

\note[itemize]{
  \item We estimate our backgrounds with Monte Carlo simulation, and we define these different regions of
    phase space in order to help simulate our backgrounds and derive corrections to them. 
  \item Starting in the top right corner is the signal region. In our signal region we have two same flavor leptons,
    so two electrons or two muons, and on the x-axis is the dilepton invariant mass. So, we
    require in the signal region that the invariant mass of the dileptons be considerably high, above 400 GeV.
    We do this in order to reduce our backgrounds.
  \item If we go to the left on the x-axis, between 60 and 150 GeV is our Drell-Yan control region. The Z peak
    is located here at about 91 GeV, so this area is dominated by Drell-Yan background. So we define our Drell
    Yan control region here to derive corrections to our Drell-Yan Monte Carlo.
  \item Lastly, in our flavor control region we have the same 400 GeV dilepton mass requirement that we have 
    in the signal region, but now we require two opposite flavor leptons, so one electron and one muon. 
  \item This region is dominated by ttbar decay, and we have no Drell-Yan or signal in this region, so we use 
    this region to derive corrections to our ttbar background.

\note[itemize]{
  \item So when I said that our main backgrounds in the signal region were Drell-Yan and $t\bar{t}$, this 
    plot quantifies that. 
  \item And I should say that the Monte Carlo and Data samples I am going to show are from Run 2 2018.
  \item So here we are looking at backgrounds in the signal region, so two same flavor leptons, muons in 
    this case, with a dilepton mass above 400 GeV.
  \item The x-axis is the four-object mass, our discriminating variable, and on the y-axis I'm showing the 
    contribution of each individual background to the total background.
  \item So we can see that at low mass around 75 percent of the background is $t\bar{t}$, and only around 20
   percent is Drell-yan. 
  \item And then as we go up in mass we get less $t\bar{t}$ and more Drell-Yan, and from the ratio plot it looks 
  like they contribute roughly the same at around 2.4 TeV.
  \item And then up in these really high four-object masses we become more Drell-Yan dominant, making up about 
  60 to 65 percent of the background. 
  \item And so for the purposes of estimating our backgrounds, the important thing to keep in mind is that 
   at low masses we are $t\bar{t}$ dominant, and at high masses we are more Drell-Yan dominant.

\note[itemize]{
  \item So now moving down the y-axis to our flavor control region, which again has the high 
    dilepton mass but opposite flavor leptons, we can check the modeling of the $t\bar{t}$ 
    background. 
  \item Here, we have the different backgrounds stacked on top of each other. This bottom plot 
    is a ratio directly comparing the total simulation to data.
  \item And overall it agrees pretty well, especially at the lower four object masses, where 
    we have a decent amount of statistics.
  \item And since the only thing that differs between this control region and the signal region 
    is the flavor of one of the leptons, it stands to reason that we can be pretty confident 
    about the $t\bar{t}$ background modeling in our signal region too.
  \item So now I am going to move us up here to the Drell-Yan Control Region so we can look at 
    the Drell-Yan modeling, and this is where things get a little more interesting.

\note[itemize]{
  \item When we first look at the Drell-Yan Control Region, we noticed that the electroweak 
    variables are in reasonable agreement, but the hadronic variables are mismodelled.
  \item For example, this plot on the right shows the transverse momentum of the leading jet.
   And you can see in the ratio plot that there is a disagreement between simulation and data 
   across the entire spectrum. 
  \item If you compare that with the transverse momentum of the leading lepton, you can see that 
   there is much better agreement with data.
  \item The cause of the hadronic mismodelling is unknown. We think that in part it may be due 
    to the fact that our Drell-Yan event generator is limited to leading order, and so this could 
    be an effect of neglecting loop corrections, and the additional factors of the strong coupling 
    constant and things like that.
  \item But not knowing exactly what is wrong with the simulations makes it very to fix.

          \begin{itemize}
            \item Scale the DY MC in each bin to agree with data. 
          \end{itemize}
          \item Apply these scale factors to all DY MC.
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
  \item A technique that is widely used in collider-based physics experiments is to derive and apply 
    a reweighting function based a kinematic variable that encapsulates the mismodelling. In this case, 
    we chose to derive the reweighting function based on the dijet mass spectrum.
  \item The reweighting function is a simple bin-by-bin correction. This plot on the left shows the 
    bin-by-bin values we are applying, and each factor is applied as weights to our Monte Carlo Drell-yan
    background.
  \item So just as an example, in this first bin the blue line for muons is at about 1.2, so if we have a Drell-Yan event
   with a weight of 1, that weight becomes 1.2. 
  \item This scales the Monte Carlo to agree with data in that bin, so that if we were to compare Data and Monte Carlo across
   the entire dijet mass spectrum after reweighting, there would be good agreement between them.
  \item And then finally, these re-weighting factors are then propagated to all of our kinematic variables 
  across all analysis regions.

  \item Here is a plot of our four object invariant mass in the Control Region.
  \item On the left is the four-object mass in the drell-yan control region without any reweighting applied. 
    Looking at this bottom ratio plot, we see that there is a discrepancy between the simulation without corrections and data.  
  \item And the discrepancy has a pretty clear slope to it, where at low mass we are underpredicting the background, and at high
    mass we overpredict it.
  \item The plot on the right is the same plot, except we have applied those dijet mass reweighting factors to the blue 
   Drell-Yan background. 
  \item And you can see that it flattens out the ratio plot, so its pulling up the background in the low mass
   region, and pulling it down a smidge in the high mass region.
  \item There still an overall disagreement, but this can be fixed by applying some overall scale factor, which wouldn't have 
   really helped before the reweighting.
  \item So, the correction works well in the Drell-Yan control region, but the question we really care about is how does this 
    reweighting affect the signal region?
  \item And the answer is that we don't know because that requires unblinding, and I would be in a lot of trouble if I made and 
    showed those plots today.

\note[itemize]{
  \item But something else we've been working on that I can show to wrap things up is this signal region
   optimization study.
  \item So the question this is getting at is, is $m_{ll} > 400$ GeV the best cut for the signal region?
  \item Or, for example, should we loosen the cut, which would amount to sliding this line to the left?
  \item Most commonly this kind of question is answered with an S over root B type of study.
  \item And here on the left we have a similar figure of merit, except we use the signal efficiency instead 
   of the signal yield, and there are some terms in the denominator that prevent the curve from blowing up 
   when the background goes to zero.
  \item And so we can see that our current cut sits on the rising edge of optimal sensitivity and the curve 
   plateus between 600 and 800 GeV.
  \item And so this suggests the 400 GeV cut might be slightly conservative for this signal mass point, but 
    I still need to check what the curves look like for a varity of different WR and signal masses.

\note[itemize]{
  \item OK so in conclusion, there are many improvements and areas of study under development in the 
   right-handed W and heavy neutrino search. 
  \item Namely, we are starting to do preliminary data and Monte Carlo comparisons in our control 
   regions for Run 3.
  \item And we have another graduate student, Sam, who has been looking at how adding a third jet to the 
   final state objects affects signal and background yields. 
  \item So most of the time extra jets in events will be soft, but maybe once in a while a third jet is 
   radiated that carries a substantial fraction of the momentum, and so by not capturing that jet we'd be 
   under-shooting the right-handed W mass. 
  \item And so Sam is looking at seeing if we can distinguish between events where we should be capturing 
    2 vs 3 jets, which might tighten up some of our signal peaks.
  \item And then finally of course on the right here I've included an image what ChatGPT thinks the right-handed W 
  might look like, so we have some idea of what to keep an eye out for.
  \item But with that, does anyone have any questions?

    \item A previous verision of this analysis did unblind, except they used the leading jet $p_T$ spectrum to 
     reweight on. And here are the results for the signal region. 
    \item So the way to read this is that the Drell-Yan is already reweighted to the leading jet $p_T$, and 
    this blue line shows what the previous background was before applying that correction.
    \item And so we see that there is initally good agreement between our uncorrected backgrounds and data, 
      and then once we apply the leading jet pt reweighting factors, we pull down our background out of agreement 
      with data.
    \item Naively, you could interpret this by saying that the leading jet pt correction worked, and this excess data that 
    we now observe in our signal region is just signal. These are right-handed W's. And that would be nice, but it is not 
    likely, since for signal we would expect a much more narrow peak, whereas the discrepancy we observe in our signal region 
    here is a much more continuous slope spanning multiple TeV, which suggests that we have a modelling problem instead of 
    actual signal. 
    \item Hence this is why we are shifting to other variables in the future.

  \item There are some neutrino people in the audience today, so I'll just mention one more reason
    why left-right symmetric models are appealing is that they provide an explanation for the tiny,
    but non-zero, mass of the left-handed standard model neutrino.
  \item It does this with something called the see-saw mechanism, which describes the lightness of the 
    left-handed standard model neutrino as the result of a suppression effect from a massive right-handed
    neutrino.
  \item And so if the parity restoration doesn't do it for you, maybe neutrino masses are a 
    better motivator.
